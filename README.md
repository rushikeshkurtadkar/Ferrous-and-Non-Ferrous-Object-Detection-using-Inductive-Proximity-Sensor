# Ferrous-and-Non-Ferrous-Object-Detection-using-Inductive-Proximity-Sensor
In this project we detects the object is rather ferrous or not using Inductive Proximity Sensor. For this project we used ESP8266 microcontroller and ESP32 camera module. We developed an embedded c code for this project so take a look into it.
